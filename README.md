Magnet
======

Magnet is a simple container widget, its particularity is to move/resize its
children to its size/position, using Animation, each time they changes.

It can be used to make changes in your interfaces more fun or more easy
to understand, easily, by automating Animation of the transformations
(if widgets make place to a new widget, or are removed and other fills
in, for example).

The transition used can be customized, as well as the duration of the
animation.

You can run the module as a standalone to have a demonstration of its
usage.
